                    Being grateful for the things you have can change your life. 
                    It helps you focus on what’s going well so you’re less likely to feel depressed about your life. 
                    Take 1-2 minutes to savor positive moments. Additionally, thank people when they do nice things for you
                </h4>
                - Keep a gratitude journal or list 3-5 things you’re grateful for each day.
                <br><br>
                - Your gratitude list might include, “my cat,” “a job I love,” “a best friend I can call anytime,” “a cozy bed,” and “good food to eat.”
                <br><br>
                - When you're feeling down, look back over your gratitude list to help you feel better.

            <h2 class = "indigo-text text-darken-2">Replace negative thoughts with positive self-talk</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <h4>
                    Negative thoughts can make it hard to feel happy, but you can change them. When you notice negative thoughts, challenge their accuracy. 
                    Then, replace the thought with a positive or neutral thought. Additionally, make positive statements to yourself throughout your day
                </h4>
                - Let's say you catch yourself thinking, “I’m so ugly.” You might replace this thought with, 
                “I can’t be ugly because everyone is beautiful in their own way,” or “I’m unique, and that makes me beautiful.”
                <br><br>
                - Use positive affirmations like, “I can do this,” “I’m enough,” or “If I try, I’m already successful.”

            <h2 class = "indigo-text text-darken-2">Compliment yourself at least once a day.</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <h4>
                    Focus on what you’re doing well by giving yourself regular compliments. 
                    Point out your best features, celebrate your talents, and recognize your accomplishments. 
                    This will help you think positively about yourself.
                </h4>
                - Say, “This outfit looks great on me,” “I did an amazing job in that presentation,” “I’m such a great writer,” or “I love that I’m so compassionate.”

            <h2 class = "indigo-text text-darken-2">Stop comparing yourself to other people.</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <h4>
                    Everyone is on their own journey, so it’s unfair to you to measure your progress by looking at what others have accomplished. 
                    Don’t worry about what other people are doing. Instead, compare yourself to where you were in the past. 
                    This will help you see how you’re progressing.
                </h4>
                - For instance, don’t worry if all your friends seem to be further along in their careers. Your time will come. Instead, compare your progress to where you were last year.

            <h2 class = "indigo-text text-darken-2">Look for something positive when you’re facing an obstacle.</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <h4>
                    Hardships and setbacks are part of life, and no one is immune from them. 
                    When you’re facing a problem, do your best to find a silver lining. 
                    This can help you feel better in the moment and may help you grow from your experiences.
                </h4>
                - For instance, don’t worry if all your friends seem to be further along in their careers. Your time will come. Instead, compare your progress to where you were last year.

            <h2 class = "indigo-text text-darken-2">Use mindfulness to help you focus on the present.</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <h4>
                    Dwelling on your past and stressing about the future can negatively affect your mood. 
                    Being mindful can help you stay focused on the present so you avoid unnecessary overthinking. 
                    Here are some ways to be more mindful

                - Engage your 5 senses.
                <br><br>
                - Do just one thing at a time.
                <br><br>
                - Focus on how your feet move against the ground.
